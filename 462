my sol (48 ms):

from statistics import median
class Solution:
    def minMoves2(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """


        mediana = median(nums)
        result = 0
        for num in nums:
            result += abs(mediana - num)

        return int(result)
I don`t know why it faster, it has O(n log n) times, my should be O(n) (mediana should work for O(n) time, maybe trouble here?)
Or maybe here just some special test
best sol (44ms):
class Solution:
    def minMoves2(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        aa = sorted(nums)
        median = aa[len(nums)//2]        
       
        return sum([abs(i-median) for i in aa])
